# Fun With Weather!

## Directions
I would like an SPA that matches the description below. Reading through the description should get you the ideas of what it supposed to accomplish. Some pieces may be ambiguous or even missing but I value your product/feature decisions (we're a team right?).

I'd like the app to be built in React but other than that the way you accomplish this is up to you. It doesn't need to look beautiful but I'd  like it to look nice and make sense to use.

Commit/comment when/how you naturally would and when you're finished submit a pull request so I can check it out. If this takes you longer than 4hrs I would say submit what you have because I'll have enough to go off of at that point.

Any questions feel free to ping me

I want to be able to search for locations and plot their forecasts. For each location I search I want to see the highs/lows of that location plotted on a graph. It would be nice if the graph would show every forcast I search for instead of just one at a time (unless I decide I don't want to see one anymore). It would also be nice to show the high or low temp forcast as well as °F or °C (for our international friends). Animating that data change would be sweet, I'd totally pay for that (maybe).
